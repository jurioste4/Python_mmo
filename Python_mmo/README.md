# Heroes of Pymoli

I was assigned the task of analyzing the data for fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As My first task, I was told would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

# My final report should include each of the following:

# Player Count

# As final considerations:
men play more then women 
player that spent the most did not alwasy by more .. they spent more per item
would like more data over longer time frame to see a better picture mabe trends 

I had to  use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
I had tosubmit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
I had to include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
